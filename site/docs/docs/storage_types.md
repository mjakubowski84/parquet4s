# Supported storage types

As it is based on Hadoop Client, Parquet4S can read and write from a variety of file systems:

- Local files
- HDFS
- [Amazon S3](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-aws/tools/hadoop-aws/index.html)
- [Google Storage](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/connectors/cloud-storage)
- [Azure Blob Storage](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-azure/index.html)
- [Azure Data Lake Storage](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-azure-datalake/index.html)
- [OpenStack Swift](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-openstack/index.html)
- and any other storage compatible with Hadoop...

Please refer to Hadoop Client documentation or your storage provider to check how to connect to your storage.
