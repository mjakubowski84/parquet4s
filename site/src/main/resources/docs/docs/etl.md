# (Experimental) ETL

Version 2.1.0 of Parquet4s introduces advanced operations on generic datasets, that is on `ParquetIterable[RowParquetRecord]`, to the core module. Now users can join and concat two or more datasets which can simplify some ETL jobs a lot.

Available operations:

- Left join
- Right join
- Inner join
- Full join
- Concat (appending one dataset to another)
- Write called directly on a dataset.

Mind that joins require loading the right-side dataset into memory, so those operations are not applicable for very large datasets. Consider switching the position of datasets in your join operation (the left dataset is iterated over). Or use e.g. Apache Spark which distributes data across multiple machines for performing join operations.

Please note that this is an experimental feature. API may change in the future, and some functionalities may be added or removed.

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import com.github.mjakubowski84.parquet4s.{Col, ParquetReader, Path}
import scala.util.Using

case class PetOwner(id: Long, name: String, petId: Long, petName: String)

// define 1st dataset
val readOwners = ParquetReader
  .projectedGeneric(
    Col("id").as[Long],
    Col("name").as[String]
  )
  .read(Path("/owners"))

// define 2nd dataset
val readPets = ParquetReader
  .projectedGeneric(
    Col("id").as[Long].alias("petId"),
    Col("name").as[String].alias("petName"),
    Col("ownerId").as[Long]
  )
  .read(Path("/pets"))

// join and write output dataset
Using.resources(readOwners, readPets) { case (owners, pets) =>
  owners
    .innerJoin(right = pets, onLeft = Col("id"), onRight = Col("ownerId")) // define join operation
    .as[PetOwner] // set typed schema and codecs
    .writeAndClose(Path("/pet_owners/file.parquet")) // execute all including write to the disk
}

// take note that all operations defined above writeAndClose are lazy and are not executed before 
// writeAndClose is called
```
